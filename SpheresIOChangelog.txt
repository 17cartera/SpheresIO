
-Known Bugs/issues:
*Units on non-owned nodes are not properly added to a team's population
*Rarely, nodes can become stuck as neutral
*Random colors can be too identical to each other
*Double-clicking is nonfunctional
*Client lag can result in moving groups appearing in an incorrect position

-Todo list: 
*Improve UI and unit selection hitboxes
*Update tutorial
*Fix group travel speed (done)
*Add handling for player disconnects

-Ideas:
*Calculate leaderboard server-side (increased bandwidth cost, but less client computation needed?)

Pre-Alpha:

5/16/17:
*Removed zoom level system, units are no longer drawn at high zoom levels
*Size of a moving group's unit cloud is based on the amount of units in it (large swarms are more noticeable)

3/24/17:
*Added leaderboard
*Added player naming system

3/23/17:
*Fixed control bugs
*Added dragging the map using the mouse
*Balancing changes: spawning time significantly increased, unit capacity decreased
*Performance improvement at high zoom level: units are now smaller

3/22/17:
*Controls overhaul
-Hold down mouse and drag to select multiple nodes, release to attack

3/21/17:
*Balancing changes
-Combat is now slower, but capturing is now faster
-Also reduced the capability of spawning while a node is in combat
-Minimum unit capacity is 10x level (or 100)
*Renamed to Spheres.io
*Increased area between each node to avoid UI overlap, reduced nodes generated
*Added a main menu
-Changed spawning system to use new menu

3/20/17:
*AI priorities overhaul
-AI is now able to capture, attack, and defend effectively
*Graphics are optimized to handle zoom (font size increases, less units are drawn)
*Fixed a bug where evacuating all units from a node could delete all units in combat

3/15/17:
*AI Change: The AI now uses a value system to determine the most valuable move
-Currenty priorities are WIP
*Fixed a bug where capturing a node removed all occupiednodes after that node

3/13/17:
*Deployed the hash map system, minimized use of the allObjects field
-Optimization: calculateUnitCapacity only looks in occupiedNodes instead of all nodes
-Optimization: hash map's range detection is used to optimize mouse selection
-Optimization: hash map's range detection is used to optimize AI target-finding

3/10/17:
*Implemented improved graphics system
*Switched to using a hash map instead of quadtree (because objects are spread out, a quadtree would be ineffective)

3/8/17:
*Reworked capturing code: nodes now have a specific team that is capturing them. If another team takes over, they will remove that capturing.
*Improved controls: double-click should be more intuitive
-Side-effect: units now have a 500ms delay between move
*Began rework of graphics engine

3/6/17:
*Fixed a bug where an AI with no controlled nodes would cause an error
*Added player elimination mechanics
*Attempted to prevent bots from making invalid moving groups
*controlledNodes changed to occupiedNodes
-should later include any node with units present on it
*Began to implement quadtree for improved range detection

3/3/17:
*Added controller object, inheritance chain for all controllers (playercontroller and botcontroller)
*Unit cap is now global, added total units indicator
*Added maximum range (units cannot be sent to points outside maximum range)
*Added terrible bot AI (bots are not capable of decision-making, and just spam units)
*Game is now pre-alpha (all core features are present)

Protocode:

3/2/17:
*Resizing now works properly
*Added zooming features
*Fixed a bug where new players could only spawn on non-neutral nodes (now only spawn on neutral nodes)
*Added random color generator, changed team generation algorithm (spawning a new team pushes out a new color as well)
*Added backbone for AI bots

3/1/17:
*Fixed a bug where removing all units from a node being captured would instantly capture (now stops capturing)
*Nodes can now spawn if no units are on the node from any team
*Attempted to fix resizing issues (failed)

2/28/17:
*Made timers for moving units, capturing, and spawning asynchronous (not based off of main gameTick)
-GameTick is only called to start these timers as needed, only triggers 10 times per second
*Implemented constants to allow for configuration
*Added multiplier to slow spawning when node is under attack
*Added graphic to show capturing progress
*Began implementing double-click feature

2/27/17:
*Completed implementation of movingGroup system
*Groups move between nodes to transfer units, instead of teleporting

2/24/17:
*Controls are disabled if the player has not spawned in yet
*Implemented movement between nodes, core game mechanic is active
*Started implementation of movingUnit class

2/23/17:

*Added spawning system (non-neutral nodes now generate units)
*Fights now use their own timer
*Added numbers to indicate the amount of units each team has on a node

*Added basic capturing system (captures are currently instant)
*Nodes start with a small amount of random units.

2/17/17:
*Added the Team array, lists colors of teams that are in the game
*Viewport now only draws objects that are inside or near the viewport
*Added support for units: units can now be added to a node, and can be drawn.
-Partially implemented combat system: units will now fight (currently linked to graphics drawing);
*Partially implemented selection system: click on a node to select it.

2/16/17:
*Added level variable to nodes, size is now based on level
*Moved drawing method to a seperate method

2/14/17:
*Added scrolling to the viewport through arrow keys
*Added mouse support (note: mouse support does not handle differing page dimensions)
